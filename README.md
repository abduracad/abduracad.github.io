<h3 align="center">Hi everyone!</h3>

I am Dr. Abdur Rahman, a postdoc fellow at the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, India. I have also done my Ph.D. thesis work at the same institute. My research interest revolves around the carbon cycle in different aquatic systems. My research career started with the reconstruction of the Himalayan paleoenvironment using stable isotopes in lake sediments. I have also worked on the recunstruction of Himalayan paleoenvironment using stable isotopes in lake sediments. I have also worked on reconstruction of forest fire and their connection with climate, human, and vegetation in the Himalayan region using black carbon.

- A collabrative work has been recently accepted in __Biogeochemistry__ in which biomarker and stable isotopes have been used to charaterized the sources of organic matter in the __Renuka lake, Central Himalaya__.
